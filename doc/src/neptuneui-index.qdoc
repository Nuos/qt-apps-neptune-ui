   \title Neptune UI
   \brief A reference HMI for the OEMs to test the Qt Automotive Suite.

   Neptune provides IVI (infotainment) system, which depends on
   \l {Qt Application Manager} for the necessary infrastructure. It comes with
   support for a Head Unit and Cluster. The system also provides the
   infrastructure to develop, maintain, and deploy applications.

   The Head Unit interface provides additional pages that are accessible
   by swiping from right-to-left or left-to-right:

   \caption \uicontrol Settings that provides more control on the HEAD Unit and
   Cluster. The \uicontrol{APP STORE} tab in the \uicontrol Settings page lets
   you install/uninstall applications from the Head Unit.

   \section1 How to Run the UI?

   Typically the UI works out-of-the-box using Qt Creator, provided you choose
   to run your application on Qt Automotive emulator, iMX6, or DriveCX targets.
   You can also run only the HMI without your application. The following
   sections provide instructions on how to run the HMI alone.

   \section2 Emulator Image

   The Qt online installer automatically creates a virtual machine setup for the
   emulator image that comes with the \QAS installation, provided you have
   VirtualBox installed before running the Qt installer.

   Use the following command to run the virtual machine setup:

   \badcode
    emulator --vbox QtAutomotive-10
   \endcode

   Where, \c emulator is a tool that is shipped with \QAS, and
   \e "QtAutomotive-10" is the name of the virtual machine setup.

   \section2 Linux Desktop

   If you are interested in exploring the reference HMI without installing
   \QAS, follow these instructions to run the HMI on your Linux desktop:

   \list 1
    \li Clone the Qt Application Manager and Neptune-UI git repositories.

    \li Build Qt Application Manager against Qt 5.6 or later that is
    installed on your desktop. See the Qt Application Manager
    \l[ApplicationManager]{Installation}{installation} page for more details
    on building.

    \li Build Neptune UI and install it by using the following command:
    \badcode
    qmake -r INSTALL_PREFIX=<choose a loation> neptuneui.pro
    make && make install
    \endcode

    \li Run the following command from the directory where \e neptune-ui is installed:
    \badcode
    appman -r -c am-config.yaml
    \endcode

    \note You can edit the \c am-config.yaml to comment out parts that
    are not relevant. For example, the SD card install location under the
    \c "installationLocations:" section.

   \endlist

   Where, \c appman is a utility that is installed when you built
   Qt Application Manager, \c AM_CONFIG_FILE points to the Application
   Manager's \c config.yaml.

   \note Add \c {-I <neptune-ui git clone>/dummyimport} to the appman command-line in case
   you don't have Qt IVI installed.


   \section2 Neptune-UI Development

   As it is inconvenient to always run "make install" when working directly on the neptune-ui,
   qmake is generating a plugins.yaml file which contains all the settings you need to run the
   UI also without installation.

   \badcode
   appman -r -c am-config.yaml -c <build-folder>/plugins.yaml
   \endcode

   In QtCreator you can use the following line:

   \badcode
   appman --recreate-database -c am-config.yaml -c %{buildDir}/plugins.yaml
   \endcode


   \section2 UI Configuration

   The UI configuration is split into several \c yaml files for the ease of
   maintenance. The following is a list of those configuration files and their
   purpose:

   \list
    \li \c config.yaml - Defines the generic parameters such as the
    install location for applications installed from the APP STORE, database,
    and so on.

    \li \c am-config.yaml - Defines the Head Unit and Cluster-specific
    configuration such as the built-in applications, their runtime (native or
    qml), import paths, UI-specific configuration such as full-screen mode,
    main QML file (if runtime is qml), and so on.

    \li \c info.yaml - Defines application-specific configuration such as the
    main QML file, its imports, and so on.
   \endlist

   The following is a sample \c am-config.yaml:

   \badcode
    formatVersion: 1
    formatType: am-configuration

    # basic AM functionality - the built-in apps are in 'apps'.

    applications:
      builtinAppsManifestDir: "apps"

    # QML apps will be able to import from modules...

    runtimes:
      qml:
        importPaths: [ "imports/shared" ]

    # ... as well as the SystemUI

    ui:
      fullscreen: yes
      mainQml: "Main.qml"
      importPaths: [ "imports/shared", "imports/system" ]
      windowIcon: "imports/shared/assets/icons/active/apps@96.png"

    systemProperties:
      public:
        showCluster: yes
      private:
        appStoreServerUrl: 'http://chaos.pelagicore.net:8080'

    # development setup: no security

    flags:
      noSecurity: yes
      noUiWatchdog: yes
   \endcode

   These options are also configurable from the command line as a
   parameter to the \e appman utility.

   \note You must regenerate the yocto image for the desired target after
   changing these \c yaml files.
